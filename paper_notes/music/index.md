## 1. Gonzalez, Manuel F., and John R. Aiello. **"More than meets the ear: Investigating how music affects cognitive task performance."** Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied 25.3 (2019): 431.


This paper explores how music affects task performance based on three factors: the type of music (simple or complex), the task complexity (simple or complex), and the listener's preference for external stimulation (introvert or extravert). Results show that music generally impairs complex task performance but complex music aids simple tasks. Preferences for external stimulation influence these effects: introverts benefit from music during complex tasks, while extraverts experience impaired performance, particularly with complex tasks. Volume also plays a role, with introverts performing better with soft music and extraverts with loud music on simple tasks.

- This paper investigate how music affects task performance in three different ways:
  - a) What one is listening to (simple music or complex music, determined by the number of instruments; more instruments make it more complex).
  - b) what task is being performed (simple task or complex task)
  - c) who is listening to the music (low [introvert] or high [extravert] preference for external stimulation). Participants completed personality measures, including the Boredom Proneness Scale, to determine their preference for external stimulation.

- The results suggest that:
  - In general:
    - **Music impaired complex task performacne**.
    - **Complex music facilitated simple task performance**.
  - However, perference for external stimulation moderated these effects,
    - **For low preference for external stimulation**:
      - Simple task:
        - complex music facilitated simple task performance, with no score difference between no music and simple music.
        - Soft volume of music (50-56dB) facilitated simple task performacne the most, followed by loud volume (62-78dB), and the least was no music.
      - Complex task:
        - Muisc facilitated complex task performance compare to no music.
    - **For high preference for external stimulation**:
      - Simple task:
        - Simple music slightly facilitated simple task performance compared to no music, while complex music impaired performance.
        - Loud volume of music (62-78dB) facilitated task performance more than no music; soft music (50-56dB) impaired task performance.
      - Complex task:
        - Music harmed task performance significantly.
